Data Science Professional Certificate by HardvardX, CYO Capstone project: Bank Marketing Analysis for Term Deposit

Marketing Campaigns are often performed to create value for customers and build strong customer relationships by focusing on the customer needs and capture value from customers in return.

The goal of this project is to analyze data, identify patterns and predict which clients will open a term deposit account. Since the outcome is to determine if the client will open or not it is a classic Classification Supervised Learning problem with two labels.
